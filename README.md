## Code Explanation

### Architecture

The application follows a simple, single-page architecture:

- **index.html**: Contains all HTML structure, CSS styling, and JavaScript functionality in a single file
- **No external dependencies**: Everything needed is embedded for immediate functionality
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

### Key Components

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Clean semantic HTML5 markup
   - Accessible and SEO-friendly structure
   - Container-based layout for responsiveness

2. **CSS Styling**
   - Modern gradient background
   - Card-based UI with shadows for depth
   - Responsive design with flexbox
   - Mobile-first approach

3. **JavaScript Functionality**
   - URL parameter parsing
   - Dynamic content loading
   - Event handling and state management
   - Error handling for robustness

### How It Works

1. The application loads and parses URL parameters
2. If a `?url=` parameter is provided, it loads that content
3. Otherwise, it displays default content
4. Results are processed and displayed within the specified timeframe
5. The UI updates dynamically based on the content

## Technical Details

- **Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: No build process required
- **GitHub Pages**: Automatic deployment on push to main branch
- **Modern Browser Support**: Works on all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
